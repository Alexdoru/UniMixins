## Production

List of test cases we have used to verify the functionality of modules. An item is checked if all of its children are either known to work, or no mod is known to use them.

All test cases assume default configs for mods.

* [x] SpongeMixins
    * [x] Mod annotation
        * [x] [BugTorch 1.1.8](https://github.com/jss2a98aj/BugTorch/releases/download/1.1.8/bugtorch-1.7.10-1.1.8.jar)
            * [x] When a cobweb is broken with unenchanted shears, a cobweb is dropped.
                * The mod hard depends on SpongeMixins in [its mod annotation](https://github.com/jss2a98aj/BugTorch/blob/95480e11c5ea922f4cc2a7540ca944ef4a9aeaec/src/main/java/jss/bugtorch/core/BugTorchCore.java#L22).
    * [x] Classpath manipulation
        * [x] [BugTorch 1.1.8](https://github.com/jss2a98aj/BugTorch/releases/download/1.1.8/bugtorch-1.7.10-1.1.8.jar) + [Witchery 0.24.1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/witchery/files/2234410)
            * [x] Garlic garlands placed while facing west have correct bounding boxes visible when highlighted.
                * Witchery is not a coremod, so if this mixin works, that means [adding it to the classpath early](https://github.com/jss2a98aj/BugTorch/blob/95480e11c5ea922f4cc2a7540ca944ef4a9aeaec/src/main/java/jss/bugtorch/core/BugTorchMixinPlugin.java#L149-L166) was successful.

            * [x] GUI Scale slider can be set to fractional values.
                * The mod hard depends on GasStation in [its mod annotation](https://github.com/basdxz/RightProperGUIScale/blob/a14814a00f7f360491f72367c40fcb31341abf7e/src/main/java/com/github/basdxz/rightproperguiscale/Tags.java#L17).

                * The mod uses the MixinBooterLegacy-style ASM package name (`org.spongepowered.libraries.org.objectweb.asm`) [in its mixin config plugin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/BugTorch/blob/3e1758a12bd92d6dabab566ed9a1e811528c655f/src/main/java/jss/bugtorch/core/BugTorchMixinPlugin.java#L13), while UniMixins uses the legacy package name (`org.spongeweb.asm.lib`). If the mod loads, that means the remapping was successful.
